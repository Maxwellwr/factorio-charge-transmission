# Charge Transmission

Special Factorio beacons that wirelessly charges bots around them. An idea by Mike C from the KatherineOfSkies community.

## Obtaining

## Uses

Hovering your cursor over a charger will display to which roboport it is connected. Chargers that share the same roboport will balance their workload between themselves (reduced lag and allows to boost the energy buffer for bot charging).

## Credits

Special thanks to:

- Mike C for the concept and not giving up on it
- Nexela for general code help and workarounds
