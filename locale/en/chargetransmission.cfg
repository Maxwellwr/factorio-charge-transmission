charge_transmission-charger=Charge transmission

[technology-description]
charge_transmission-charger=Adapt beacon technology as to transmit power wirelessly to entities within their range.

[mod-setting-name]
charge_transmission-use-modules=Modules on chargers
charge_transmission-have-beams=Show charging beams
charge_transmission-robots-per-tick=Robots per tick
charge_transmission-recharges-per-second=Recharges per second

[mod-setting-description]
charge_transmission-use-modules=Allows (effectivity only) modules inside chargers to counteract their increased power usage (x3.0~x1.5), otherwise chargers will default to x1.5.
charge_transmission-have-beams=Creates electrical sparks when charging a robot.\nDisabling may increase performance, but it will not look as cool.
charge_transmission-robots-per-tick=How many robots are processed and recharged per tick (1/60 of a second), set 0 for infinite.\nBigger values may cause a performance penalty.
charge_transmission-recharges-per-second=How often a node (roboport, player, ...) will attempt to wirelessly recharge robots around it.\nBigger values *will* cause a performance penalty!

[custom-alert]
charge_transmission-overtaxed=Wireless robot system overtaxed.
