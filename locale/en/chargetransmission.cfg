[mod-setting-name]
charge_transmission-use-modules=Modules on chargers
charge_transmission-have-beams=Show charging beams
charge_transmission-robots-limit=Robots per tick
charge_transmission-nodes-interval=Node pooling interval

[mod-setting-description]
charge_transmission-use-modules=Allows (effectivity only) modules inside chargers to lower their energy losses.\nWarning: If you plan to toggle off this option remove any placed modules before so, as you will not be able to access said modules until you turn this option back on (they will not be deleted, only hidden).
charge_transmission-have-beams=Creates electrical sparks when charging a robot. Disabling may increase performance, but it will not look as cool.
charge_transmission-robots-limit=How many robots are processed and recharged per tick. Bigger values will have a performance penalty!
charge_transmission-nodes-interval=Once a node (roboport, player, ...) has recharged robots, how many ticks until it checks for new targets. Smaller values will have a performance penalty!
